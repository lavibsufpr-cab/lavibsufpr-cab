<p>The application of scientific knowledge related to vibration and sound phenomena is of crucial importance in the design and analysis of the dynamic behavior of structures, machines and acoustic cavities, aiming to improve comfort and safety conditions, as well as to increase the useful life of mechanical components and systems.</p>
<p>Products with reduced levels of vibration and radiated noise have been increasingly in demand both nationally and, especially, internationally, often resulting in the conquest or loss of markets. </p>
<p>The Research Group on Vibrations and Sound in Mechanical Systems (GVIBS) has, in a fruitful partnership with the distinguished Professor José João de Espíndola, developed its own methodologies for the control of vibrations and radiated noise, through the use of viscoelastic materials and devices, both in non-rotating and rotating mechanical systems.</p>
<p>The developments made by the group are included in several scientific papers presented at conferences and published in national and international indexed journals.</p>
<p>As a result of this work, several national and international patents have also been generated. Research Lines:
<ul>
  <li>Passive, active-adaptive and mixed control of vibrations and radiated noises, using viscoelastic and hybrid devices and Helmholtz resonators.</li>
  <li>Identification and control with viscoelastic materials in Rotor Dynamics.</li>
  <li>Study of the dynamic behavior of composite structures.</li>
  <li>Identification and control with viscoelastic dynamic neutralizers in nonlinear systems.</li>
  <li>Damage prognosis in structures and machines.</li>
  <li>Dynamic characterization of viscoelastic materials.</li>
  <li>Prospecting for new devices in the control of vibrations and radiated noises.</li>
